#PROBLEM 1: Factorial Calculation

 # This problem 1 calculates the factorial of n (n!).
Register r0 holds the input, r1 is the result initialized to 1, and r2 is the loop counter, also initialized to 4 .
The program enters a loop that runs if the counter r2 is greater than 1.
It multiplies the running result in r1 by the current counter r2.
It then decrements the counter (SUB r2, r2, #1).
The loop executes for r2 = 4, 3, and 2. When reaches 1, the loop terminates. The result, 24 in decimal and 18 in hexadecimal, is stored in register r1.
